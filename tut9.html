     <h2>File Management</h2>
     <p>
     	<ul>
    <li> 	It means the os manages the info or data, in other words Managing the information from which or to which it should be sent/ received.</li>

<li>File system in os keeps the track of information,its location and everything.</li>

<li>It also decides on which user should get resources first and enforce the protection requirements and also provide accessing routines.</li>

<li>Necessaryinformation like opening a file,reading a file is taken care by the file system and finally it reclaim the resources like closing a file.</li>
     </p>

     <h3>File Attributes and File Operations</h3>
     <p>
     	File attribute. File attributes are metadata associated with computer files that define file system behavior. Each attribute can have one of two states: set and cleared. Attributes are considered distinct from other metadata, such as dates and times, filename extensions or file system permissions.
    </p>

     <h3>File Directories</h3>
     <p>
     	A directory is a location for storing files on your computer. Directories are found in a hierarchical file system, such as Linux, MS-DOS, OS/2, and Unix.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/ywWPul7VAwM"> click here </a>

     <h3>File Allocation Methods</h3>
       <p>
       	<ul>

       <li>	The location of a file is defined by the disk address of the first block and its length.</li>
<li>A file allocated disk space using contiguous allocation method.</li>
<li>Example of a file which has been allocated disk space using linked allocation method.</li>
<li>a file allocated disk space using Indexed allocation Method.</li>
</ul>

<h3>File Access Methods</h3>
<p>
	Usually a single access method is supported by systems while there are OS's that support multiple access methods.

<ul>
	<li>Sequential Access. Data is accessed one record right after another is an order. ...</li>
<li>Direct Access. This method is useful for disks. ...</li>
<li>Indexed Sequential Access. It is built on top of Sequential access.</li>
</ul>

       <h3>Free Space Management</h3>
       <p>
       	  Since disk space is limited, we need to reuse the space from deleted files for new files, if possible. (Write-once optical disks only allow one write to any given sector, and thus such reuse is not physically possible.) To keep track of free disk space, the system maintains a free-space list. The free-space list records all free disk blocksâ€”those not allocated to some file or directory. To create a file, we search the free-space list for the required amount of space and allocate that space to the new file. This space is then removed from the free-space list.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/pDMonZ4TbwA"> click here </a>

       <h3>Protection & Security Introduction</h3>
       <p>
       	 Interference in resource utilization is a very serious threat in an OS. The nature of the threat depends on the nature of a resource and the manner in which it is used. <br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/uFIzD1k5S5U"> click here </a>
