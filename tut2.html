     <h2>Memory Management</h2>
     <p>
   
Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/TAk822Wz4x4"> click here </a>

     <h3>Logical vs Physical Address Space</h3>
     <p>
     	Image result for Logical vs Physical Address Space
Logical address space is set of logical addresses that generated by a program. The physical address is address that seen by memory unit and used to access memory units. Virtual addresses are mapped with physical addresses by memory management.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/CmTMr_x3NwY"> click here </a>

     <h3>Swapping</h3>
     <p>
     	Swapping is a mechanism in which a process can be swapped temporarily out of main memory (or move) to secondary storage (disk) and make that memory available to other processes. At some later time, the system swaps back the process from the secondary storage to main memory.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/GJeeznJT8ts"> click here </a>

     <h3>Contiguous Memory Allocation</h3>
     <p>
     	The memory is usually divided into two partitions: one for the resident operating system, and one for the user processes. We may place the operating system in either low memeory or high memory. With this approach each process is contained in a single contiguous section of memory.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/LLhgnIYpQaI"> click here </a>

     <h4>Fixed / Variable size partitioning</h4>
     <p>
     	The mamory is partitioned to fixed size partition. Although the partitions are of fixed size, they need not be of equal size. There is a problem of wastage of memory in fixed size even with unequal size. When a process is brought into memory, it is placed in the smallest available partition that will hold it. <br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/PuZ_xChlInM"> click here </a>

     <h3> Address Translation- Logical Address to Physical Address </h3>
     <p>
     	Address translation concatenates the frame number with the offset part of a logical address to form a physical address. A page table base register (PTBR) holds the base address for the page table of the current process. It is a processor register that is managed by the operating system.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/8_dDcNzogSg"> click here </a>

     <h3> Fragmentation </h3>
     <p>
     	In computer storage, fragmentation is a phenomenon in which storage space is used inefficiently, reducing capacity or performance and often both. The exact consequences of fragmentation depend on the specific system of storage allocation in use and the particular form of fragmentation.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/wBauJ09oI48"> click here </a>

     <h3> Paging </h3>
     <p>
     	Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non â€“ contiguous. <br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/xAvC-MJ_Sz8"> click here </a>

     <h3> Segmentation </h3>
     <p>
     	Segmentation is one of the most common ways to achieve memory protection. In a computer system using segmentation, an instruction operand that refers to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset within that segment. A segment has a set of permissions, and a length, associated with it.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/K01mVeWkLSY"> click here </a>
