	<h2>Operating System</h2>
	<p>
		The operating system (OS) is the most important program that runs on a computer. Every general-purpose computer must have an operating system to run other programs and applications. Computer operating systems perform basic tasks, such as recognizing input from the keyboard, sending output to the display screen, keeping track of files and directories on the storage drives, and controlling peripheral devices, such as printers.<br> read more...<a href="https://youtu.be/YwqexcfbucE"> click here </a>

	<h2>Types of Operating System</h2>
	<p>
		There are various types of operating systems. Some are as follows:-
		<p>1-Batch Operating System:- The users of a batch operating system do not interact with the computer directly. Each user prepares his job on an off-line device like punch cards and submits it to the computer operator. To speed up processing, jobs with similar needs are batched together and run as a group.<br> read more...<a href="https://youtu.be/VtqPyXDaMr4"> click here </a></p>

		<p>2-Time-sharing operating systems:- A time sharing system allows many users to share the computer resources simultaneously. In other words, time sharing refers to the allocation of computer resources in time slots to several programs simultaneously. For example a mainframe computer that has many users logged on to it. Each user uses the resources of the mainframe -i.e. memory, CPU etc. The users feel that they are exclusive user of the CPU, even though this is not possible with one CPU i.e. shared among different users.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/UcXWaeRikSo"> click here </a></p>

		<p>3-Distributed operating System:- Distributed Operating System is a model where distributed applications are running on multiple computers linked by communications. A distributed operating system is an extension of the network operating system that supports higher levels of communication and integration of the machines on the network.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/nH9uwoyczFc"> click here </a></p>

		<p>4-Network operating System:- A network operating system (NOS) is a computer operating system system that is designed primarily to support workstation, personal computer, and, in some instances, older terminal that are connected on a local area network (LAN). Artisoft's LANtastic, Banyan VINES, Novell's NetWare, and Microsoft's LAN Manager are examples of network operating systems. In addition, some multi-purpose operating systems, such as Windows NT and Digital's OpenVMS come with capabilities that enable them to be described as a network operating system.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/tXlEVveUJY0"> click here </a></p>

		<p>5-Real Time operating System:- A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS) intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays. Processing time requirements (including any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of time.<br> read more... <a href="https://youtu.be/oWmTJdYYRTg"> click here </a> click here </p>
