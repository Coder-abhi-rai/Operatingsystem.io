	  <p>Hello everyone, My name is Abhijeet Singh and I am pursuing Bachelor's in Computer Application. I did my schooling from Sunbeam Academy, Samneghat from Varanasi itself. I belong from Varanasi and I know the hardships faced by students in learning and getting educated. I want the betterment of students everywhere and that's why I am going to open a website on "Operating System" which will help students all across to study in a better and organised way. I would really like your support in my project. 
This project will surely be helpful to all the students in getting educated in a better form. And it will really make a difference in your study pattern and I hope this helps you to as much extent as it can.<br>
Thank you.</p>
